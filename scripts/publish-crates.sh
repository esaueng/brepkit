# Publish every publishable crate to crates.io, in dependency order, skipping
# any already at this version.
#
# Used two ways:
#   - `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs it on each release, authenticating
#     via OIDC trusted publishing.
#   - A human runs it once per crate name to bootstrap. crates.io only accepts
#     a trusted-publisher config for a crate that already exists, so the FIRST
#     version of each crate must be pushed manually with an API token. Verify
#     the packages before putting that token in the environment:
#       cargo publish --workspace --dry-run
#       CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN=<token> ./scripts/publish-crates.sh
#
# Skipping already-published crates is what makes a re-run after a partial
# failure safe, and it is why this does not just call
# `cargo publish --workspace` (which aborts the batch on the first crate that
# already exists).
#
# Order is cargo's own topological order; `cargo package --workspace` prints
# it. brepkit-wasm-macros is `publish = false` and is deliberately absent.
