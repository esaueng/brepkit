## Why build a CAD kernel?

brepkit is a from-scratch B-Rep kernel in Rust targeting WebAssembly. `unsafe` is forbidden, `unwrap` and `panic` are denied by default. Every public operation returns `Result`.

The project grew out of building [gridfinitylayouttool.com](https://gridfinitylayouttool.com), where the existing options for parametric CAD in the browser were proprietary or compiled from C++.

## Status

brepkit is in active development. Core modeling works. Some areas are still maturing.

## Scope

To set expectations, this project deliberately does not:

- **Render scenes or manage viewports** — brepkit produces geometry and tessellated meshes; rendering (camera, lighting, shading) is left to the caller (e.g. Three.js, wgpu).
- **Perform toolpath planning or slicing** — export STEP, STL, or 3MF and pass the output to a CAM tool or slicer (Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, etc.).
- **Support mesh-based modeling** — the kernel operates on exact B-Rep geometry; subdivision surfaces, polygon meshes, and voxel representations are out of scope.
- **Provide a GUI or interactive editor** — brepkit is a library; building a UI around it (like [gridfinitylayouttool.com](https://gridfinitylayouttool.com)) is the application's responsibility.
- **Simulate physics or perform FEA** — measurement (volume, CoM, inertia) is included, but stress analysis, collision detection, and dynamics are not.

## Roadmap

Broad directions, no dates.

- **Boolean completeness** — extend the unified General Fuse pipeline to all surface types including torus
- **Sweep generalization** — non-planar profile support for revolve, sweep, loft, and pipe
- **Parallel tessellation in WASM** — native builds already parallelize per-face meshing; bring it to the (single-threaded) WASM target via threads
- **Assembly metadata** — colors, layers, materials, and PMI for richer data exchange
- **Expanded I/O** — lossless IGES round-trips and broader STEP entity coverage
- **Documentation** — API reference, tutorials, and architectural guides

## Architecture

Layered Cargo workspace. Crates depend only on the same or lower layers. Boundaries are enforced by CI.

| Layer | Crate                | What it does                                                                                       |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| L2    | `brepkit-offset`     | Solid offset and thickening via global face-face intersection                                      |

| L4    | `brepkit-wasm`       | JavaScript API via wasm-bindgen with batch execution and checkpoint/restore                        |

## Performance

Median times from the [brepjs benchmark suite](https://github.com/andymai/brepjs/tree/main/benchmarks) (5 iterations, Node.js, Linux x86_64). WASM is single-threaded; native benchmarks use criterion.

| Operation                | brepkit (WASM) | OCCT (WASM) | Speedup | brepkit (native) |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| fuse(box, box)           | 0.6 ms         | 45.1 ms     | 75x     | 117 µs           |
| cut(box, cylinder)       | 61.4 ms        | 71.2 ms     | 1.2x    | 24.8 ms          |
| intersect(box, sphere)   | 0.3 ms         | 63.9 ms     | 210x    | 97 µs            |
| box + chamfer            | 0.1 ms         | 6.5 ms      | 65x     | 45 µs            |
| box + fillet             | 0.3 ms         | 6.2 ms      | 21x     | 74 µs            |
| multi-boolean (16 holes) | 7.6 ms         | 30.7 ms     | 4.0x    | 4.1 ms           |
| mesh sphere (tol=0.01)   | 34.8 ms        | 50.0 ms     | 1.4x    | 1.5 ms           |
| exportSTEP (×10)         | 0.8 ms         | 14.6 ms     | 18x     | —                |

Booleans preserve analytic surfaces, keeping face counts low (72 vs ~7,000 for a 9-step compound boolean).

> OCCT comparison uses [occt-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/occt-wasm), an OpenCASCADE build compiled to WebAssembly. Both kernels run single-threaded in Node.js. Boolean and `exportSTEP` rows are timed as batches of ten operations. Native benchmarks: `cargo bench -p brepkit-operations`. Full benchmark source: [brepjs/benchmarks](https://github.com/andymai/brepjs/tree/main/benchmarks). Measured 2026-06-14.

## Data Exchange

| Format     | Type  | Import | Export |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| STEP AP203 | B-Rep | ✓      | ✓      |
| IGES       | B-Rep | ✓      | ✓\*    |
| STL        | Mesh  | ✓      | ✓      |
| 3MF        | Mesh  | ✓      | ✓      |
| OBJ        | Mesh  | ✓      | ✓      |
| PLY        | Mesh  | ✓      | ✓      |
| glTF       | Mesh  | ✓      | ✓      |

STEP preserves exact geometry on round-trip, including analytic surfaces (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus). \*IGES export currently writes planar and NURBS surfaces; analytic surfaces (cylinder, cone, sphere, torus) are not yet exported, though their edges are. Mesh formats export tessellated triangles.
