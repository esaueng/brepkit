//! Captured-operand READY-REPRO for the 2x2 label-bracket fuse (#1510).
//!
//! `fuse(bin body, label bracket)` is the single boolean that owns the tool's
//! label-bracket row: 95ms of the generation's 124ms of boolean time, because
//! raw GFA returns an OPEN shell and `operations::boolean` pays for the mesh
//! fallback (121 all-planar faces where the operands carry 8 cylinders).
//!
//! Both operands are well-formed (free=0, over=0, 0 unmatched directed
//! half-edges each), so this is not a fallback-poisoned capture.
//!
//! Geometry: the bin's cavity wall sits at +-40.550 with r=2.55 corners centred
//! on (+-38, +-38); the bracket is a box x +-40.550, y 28.550..40.550, whose top
//! at z=16.010 pokes 0.01mm above the bin's top at z=16.000 (the consuming
//! tool's deliberate coplanar overlap). The bracket's corners are SQUARE while
//! the cavity's are ROUNDED, so the cavity corner cylinder is exactly TANGENT
//! to the plane y=40.550 at x=+-38.
//!
//! The defect: the splitter builds the right complement sub-face on the
//! bracket's back wall (an inverted-U: the outer rectangle x +-40.550,
//! z 14.800..16.010 minus a notch at x +-38, z 14.800..16.000), but that
//! sub-face STRADDLES the bin's boundary. Its side columns (|x| in 38..40.550,
//! below z=16.000) are inside the bin's material, because the square corner
//! intrudes into the rounded cavity corner; its top strip (z 16.000..16.010) is
//! outside. One classification verdict cannot be right for both, the drop
//! verdict wins, and the whole back wall vanishes — leaving a 10-edge hole.
//!
//! The split that would separate them runs along z=16.000 for |x| in
//! [38, 40.550]. Phase FF DOES compute that section across the full width —
//! `BK_FF_DUMP` reports the Id(18)/Id(23) section spanning x -40.550..40.550 —
//! but only its |x| < 38 portion ends up bounding the sub-face. So the defect
//! is not a missed section; it is that the section's outer pieces are never
//! applied as split edges here. x=+-38 is where the section gets broken, being
//! the tangency point, which points at pave-block attachment rather than at
//! section computation.
//!
//! Ready-repro: the assertion below is what a fix must satisfy. It is ignored
//! because every change in that area has to clear the full face-splitter foil
//! set (d4 gridfinity, honeycomb pcut1/pcut3, divider-lip, groove-mouth,
//! junction-disc, cylinder-slot, a1corner).
