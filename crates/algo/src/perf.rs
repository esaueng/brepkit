//! Deterministic work counters for complexity-regression guards.
//!
//! These count the *inner work* of the boolean hot paths that were once
//! O(N²) — the pave-vertex coincidence lookup and the same-domain polygon
//! clip — so a test can assert the work grows sub-quadratically with input
//! size. Counting work (not wall-clock) makes the guard deterministic: a
//! reintroduced per-item full scan turns a linear count into a quadratic one,
//! which trips the bound with no timing flakiness.
//!
//! The counters are gated behind the `perf-counters` feature. With the feature
//! off (every normal and release build) the `bump_*` calls are empty `#[inline]`
//! functions that compile to nothing, so the instrumented hot loops pay zero
//! cost. The scaling guard enables the feature only for its own test build.
