//! # brepkit-topology
//!
//! Boundary representation (B-Rep) topological data structures.
//!
//! This is layer L1, depending only on `brepkit-math`.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! All topological entities are stored in a central [`Arena`] and referenced
//! via typed index handles ([`VertexId`], [`EdgeId`], etc.). This avoids
//! reference counting overhead and enables efficient traversal.
