# Roadmap: choosing what to work on

This is the sanctioned work-selection doctrine for autonomous sessions. It says what
is open and ready, what is TERMINAL (do not re-attempt without new tooling), which
work to chase and which to skip, and the bar a case must clear to be called closed.

## This is a LIVING document: maintenance is mandatory

When a session **closes, defers, or discovers** a work item, it MUST update this skill
in the same PR. A stale roadmap is worse than none: past sessions burned large budgets
rediscovering dead ends this file was supposed to name. Keep every entry to ONE line
with a pointer (a test path, a git-history PR number, a memory-free source file) that
carries the detail. Never duplicate the detailed truth here; point at the repro.
**Closed-campaign narrative is rot: when a case closes, collapse its entry to one line
plus its fixture/PR pointer in the Closed section, and delete the dig log.**

The `#[ignore]` inventory is the load-bearing artifact. Before quoting any
"deferred" claim, regenerate and reconcile it:

```bash
rg -n -A2 '#\[ignore' crates/    # filter the doc-comment false hits by hand
```

**Inventory status (2026-08-09): CLEAN.** Every remaining `#[ignore]` is an explicit
diagnostic or a slow-test marker — zero deferred-defect pins. Known stale-but-harmless:
the `profile_intersect.rs` box-sphere probes (box-sphere shipped analytic in #1006),
`staircase_fuse_with_cylinders` (~2 min perf run), the two `#696` dovetail entries and
`diverge_first_cut` (print-only).

## When to use

- Starting a session with no assigned task and needing to pick high-value work.
- A task resembles something that may already be tried, closed, or proven impossible.
- Deciding whether an analytic-recovery or parity case is worth the budget.
- Before writing "this case is closed" anywhere.

## The north star

Replace the incumbent kernel in the gridfinity layout tool (`~/Git/gridfinity-layout-tool`)
at full parity, across all its generator scenarios: 100% triangle correctness, volume
correctness, manifold correctness, AND generation performance at least as good. Parity
first, then beating it, is the acceptance bar. See `parity-benchmarking` for the harness.

Where that stands: **every head-to-head bench row leads** (last full sweep 2026-08-07 on
released kernels, equivalence verified per row; the weakest rows were closed by #1389
mesh-sphere, #1396 exact all-planar volume, #1408/#1410 intersect octant). Gridfinity bin
parity is reached; the full tool generator directory is green; all four primitive-boolean
fallbacks are exact analytic. Per-PR history and per-row numbers live in git, MEMORY.md,
and the bench harness — do not re-record them here. Native criterion CAVEAT: the
cad_operations "mesh sphere" case runs a bench-local PER-FACE shim ~40x lighter than the
solid-level path — never compare it to solid-level numbers (`perf_probe` has the matching
native figure).

**The lesson that most reshapes triage: not every scenario failure is a boolean
fallback, and many are not geometry at all.** The honeycomb triangle blow-up and the
compartment non-manifold family both replayed with ZERO mesh fallbacks (roots were
tessellation density, shared-rim meshing, face orientation), and 18 of the 21
divider/floor failures were a missing brepjs ADAPTER method that threw before any
geometry ran. So: measure where the failure actually is before assuming GFA — capture
the real boolean traffic and replay it natively (recipe under "Tool-side measurement
recipes"). A family that fails in seconds is failing pre-geometry.

## The priority filters (rules with reasons)

1. **Chase operations that RE-CREATE an existing analytic surface type. Do NOT chase
   ops that INVENT a blend or approximation surface.** A boolean or revolve result face
   is a trimmed patch of an *input* surface, so it is always closable with the right
   split. Fillet and chamfer walls, general sweep and loft side faces, and offsets of
   NURBS input introduce a NEW surface with no closed form; they are fundamentally
   approximate. See `analytic-preservation`.
2. **Solve the NARROW case (coaxial, perpendicular, equal-radius), not the general
   problem.** Every primitive-boolean win was gated to one specific configuration and
   defers to the generic marcher otherwise. Sessions that reached for a general solver
   burned budget and shipped nothing.
3. **Prefer work with a stable primitive repro over work that needs tooling first.**
   The four primitive-boolean cases (stable repros in
   `crates/operations/examples/approx_census.rs`) were picked over the tooling-blocked
   scoop case for exactly this reason.
4. **After ANY GFA or boolean change, re-probe scenario face counts before claiming
   anything.** Scorecards rot silently; a stale one once hid a regression through a
   whole release. This is mandatory, not optional (see `parity-benchmarking`).

## TERMINAL cases: do not re-attempt without the named missing primitive

Several past sessions burned large budgets rediscovering these. Each needs a component
that does not exist yet; without it, stop.

- **Equal-radius perpendicular cylinder-union RENDER.** The exact seam is a
  self-touching figure-eight (a genuine non-manifold singularity, odd Euler). The
  shipped artifact (#1008: analytic B-Rep whose marched-NURBS seam dodges the touch,
  plus exact closed-form volume) STANDS. Needs a face-split-at-pinch primitive on a
  periodic wall, or a periodic-aware crossing-holes mesher. There is no
  `exact_cylinder_cylinder` symbol; do not go looking for one.
- **Plane-by-sphere splitting across the chord-discretized equator.** The general
  capability behind box-sphere; a section circle's crossings miss a polygon-approximated
  equator by the sagitta. Box-sphere was closed (#1006) with a case-specific seam-plane
  fit (`rg -n 'seam_plane' crates/`). The general fix is a UV-space arrangement
  splitter, a dedicated multi-day component not yet built. The boundary-plane
  crossing technique is proven and reusable.
- **Gridfinity scoop fuse (3x3 scoop+label+lip).** Root: a lip-foot cone must be split
  with a coordinated staircase cone-split plus bracket-cap re-trim sharing the new edge;
  every one-sided attempt regresses. Many sequential autonomous passes exhausted.
  Parity is already MET via a correct-but-slow mesh fallback (this is perf-only).
  In-memory repros exist (`crates/io/tests/scoop*_inmem.rs`); the blocker is the
  coordinated split, not tooling.
- **A universal smarter merge-key for duplicate edges. PROVEN UNBUILDABLE.** The
  gridfinity lip corner (chord + arc, same endpoints) MUST merge; the torus-box in-tube
  lens (line + co-endpoint arc) MUST stay distinct. No merge-key discriminant separates
  them; the distinction is global. Sanctioned pattern: splitter-side midpoint splits,
  per case, so no two edges share both endpoints, and leave
  `merge_duplicate_edges` (in `crates/algo/src/builder/builder_solid.rs`) alone. Control
  the geometry you emit; do not make the shared merge smarter.
- **Pinch-shim double-cover mesh residuals (groupedScoop case2 nm=75).** Two coincident
  face meshes span the same region by construction, so shared rim edges carry 3
  triangles; inherent to the shim encoding — the alternative is the face-split-at-pinch
  primitive above. Sub-export-tolerance (tool suites 7/7); parked in this row on purpose.

## OPEN: ready or gated work

| Item | Status / next step |
|---|---|
| **#1488 baseplate perf** | KERNEL-SIDE CLOSED, verified on released 3.2.13 (2026-08-09, same-machine stage breakdown, gridfinity-layout-tool#3348 harness): plates went from 4-27x behind to parity-or-faster on 3 of 4 rows (6x4 magnets residual 1.25x, no pathological stage). Two roots: #1490 (grazing plane-cone chains fed the O(n³) fit) and #1495 (edge-tangent PREVIEW pockets made every cluster fuse mesh-fallback; the blob poisoned every later boolean — the non-monotonic corner-clip anomaly was its collateral). Issue closure is Andy's re-run. Guards: `tangent_graze_section_fit_is_clipped`, `compound_cut_edge_tangent_tools_stays_analytic`; repro/probe paths in the memory `project_baseplate-graze-perf` |
| **Mesh-boolean fallback emits OPEN meshes that are CONSUMED** | A product call, not just a fix: rejecting means the op fails outright. Mitigation shipped: `boolean::mesh_fallback_count()` + wasm `meshFallbackCount()` let pipelines snapshot-and-refuse |
| **Export angular default (5°) vs the reference's coarser effective default** | Tolerance-parity product choice, not mesher waste: 5° forces 18 segments/quarter-arc on r=0.6 slot corners, ~1.7x triangles vs reference at fine deflection. Revisit only as a product decision |
| **Kumiko corner-window roots (4, documented)** | Unshipped; the parked branch `fix/kumiko-corner-window-cut` is GONE from the remote with its fixtures. Re-attempting means re-capturing fixtures first |
| **Marched FF sections carry `pave_block_id=None`** | Architectural note without a live repro (the snapClip op-cut-3 case replays clean, fixture `snapclip_export_corner_inmem.rs` ACTIVE). If a new leak lands here, the canonical altitude is pave-block attachment at phase-FF/make_blocks — every face-splitter-level attempt broke calibrated chains |
| **v1 fillet deprecations entangled with the public wasm API** | `try_fillet` still reaches deprecated `fillet`/`fillet_rolling_ball`; migrating changes public behavior — a product decision, not safe cleanup. See `fillet-blend`, `wasm-bindings` |
| **crates.io / GTM items** | Andy-only. Publishing infrastructure works (see MEMORY.md for the release-please `continue-on-error` masking gotcha) |

## Closed: root cause + where the detail lives

One line each; the fixture/PR carries the story. Newest first.

- **FF sampled plane-analytic chains fit unclipped (#1488 kernel side)** — grazing
  plane-cone hyperbolas fed ~512 points to the dense O(n³) interpolate per pair; clipped
  to the face-pair AABB overlap, closed loops stay whole-or-dropped (torus-notch canary).
  #1490, guard `tangent_graze_section_fit_is_clipped`, probe `examples/plate_probe.rs`
- **CDT lift missed constraint-recovery Steiner vertices (#1487)** — crossing splits and
  the bisection backstop mint vertices the caller never saw; masked pre-#1478 by the
  interior-grid resize; panicked and poisoned the wasm kernel. #1489, test
  `cdt_covers_steiner_vertices_from_constraint_recovery`
- **GH campaign #1445/#1446/#1447 (2026-08-08, closed on released 3.2.5)** — slots DCEL
  rescue for non-periodic bands, fillet-v2 campaign (56→0 free edges), pinch-shim SD gate,
  v2 orientation emission, CDT winding vote, pinch-u unwrap, display-density floor
  threading (#1478). Fixtures: `slots_lipcone_cut_inmem.rs`, `scoop_fillet_variable_inmem.rs`,
  `gscoop_pinch_cut_inmem.rs`, four scoop fixtures with orientation pins. Detail: MEMORY.md
  Feature Parity Status + the fixture doc comments
- **Sweep/pipe/miter placement family** — `sweep()` re-centered profiles onto the path
  (lip z-shift); perpendicular profiles now sweep as-positioned across sweep/pipe/
  sweep_with_options/miter; `compute_frames` domain-mapping fixed for split sub-paths;
  analytic spine sweep shipped (#1421/#1427/#1438, releases 3.0.1–3.1.3). `helical_sweep`
  keeps re-centering by contract (`ProfilePlacement::CentroidOnPath`). Pins:
  `*_keeps_offset_profile_position*`, `analytic_spine_sweep_lip_ring_is_exact`
- **Coincident-fuse nondeterminism** — shell_op rim assembly iterated a HashMap for
  boundary edges; wire origin rotated the splitter UV frame run-to-run. One-line sort fix;
  `exact_coincident_lip_fuse_stays_analytic` un-ignored
- **shell_op cavity corner cylinders same-sense** — three coordinated wire/rim orientation
  fixes. #1435, `shelled_rounded_box_is_orientation_clean`
- **Orientation-emission campaign** (loft/revolve/extrude/sweep/blend + splitter winding +
  fuse crescent classification + loft cylinder-arm mint) — check_orientation defaults ON;
  see MEMORY.md for the durable winding rules. #1365-#1377, #1394, #1404
- **Mixed-detail 511 residual** — 395 CDT flip-recovery stall (Steiner bisection in
  recover_edge) + 20 same-sense (#1394 pcurve-fold crescents) + 116 loft cylinder mint
  (#1404); chain verified clean on released 2.129.13. `mixed_socket_tess_inmem.rs`
- **Export matrix drift** — O-shape (ray-cast conflict re-cast, #1357) + slotted no-lip
  (SD cross-shell gate, #1360); 73/73. Fixtures volume-pinned;
  `slotted_nolip_fuse_inmem.rs`, `oshape_socket_fuse_inmem.rs`
- **Mitsukude panel cut** — missing FF section: `sample_plane_cone`'s uniform-u sweep
  aliased past the asymptote; chain ends now extend to the exact v_max boundary.
  Fixture volume-pinned; kumiko-dividers 166.6s → 25.5s
- **Kumiko lattice band fuse — closed after 29 passes** (#1302,
  `kumiko_lattice_bands_fuse_closed` un-ignored). Final mechanism, all in the face
  splitter: (1) DEMAND-GATED outer-wire pave-image expansion (3e-3 near-miss gate, both
  broader gates measured harmful); (2) pendant→boundary-vertex bridge (section-free
  targets only); (3) pendant→pendant bridge (mutually nearest within 3e-3, 10x isolation,
  twin-deduped). The pass-27 "near-coincident slope SD" framing was REFUTED by direct
  measurement (planes 15° apart). Honeycomb residuals re-pinned
- **Kumiko corner wedge coaxial cut** — NURBS boundary chord anchoring: sampled
  sign-change bisection in `clip_line_to_face_boundary` (#1343) + circle-gated NURBS
  boundary-image expansion (#1352). `kumiko_corner_wedge_inmem.rs`, volume-pinned
- **Thick-wall cavity** — two stacked roots in shell_op's collapsed-corner arm (miter fed
  both extreme normals; sharp-corner chamfer strip emitted). All cases bnd=0. Pins:
  `shell_thickness_past_corner_radius_gives_a_sharp_corner`,
  `thickwall_sharp_cavity_fuse_inmem.rs`
- **v2 trimmer residuals** — `dihedral_half_angle` returned the normals' half-angle where
  the material wedge half-angle `(pi-angle)/2` was needed; coincide only at 90°.
  `regress_blend_keepside_tangency.rs` un-ignored; refutation history in fixture docs
- **Bench intersect(corner box, center sphere)** — three stacked roots (outward-normal
  270° complement arcs, same-sense patch wire, planar-polygon containment on a
  non-planar octant patch). `bench_equiv_intersect_box_corner_sphere_is_the_octant`
- **Bench cut(box,cyl) 2.3% deviation** — endpoint-exclusion class in three boundary
  samplers dropped polygon corner vertices; plus unsigned fan areas in check::properties.
  `bench_equiv_cut_box_corner_cylinder_volume_is_exact`
- **Snap-clip deepened notch (both faces)** — cone variant via outer-region section clip
  (#1102); plane variant via `union_internal_loop_with_hole` (all-Line, interaction-gated).
  `deepened_wall_opening_inmem.rs`. Arc-bounded openings still bail by design
- **Divider scenarios 15/15** — the 3 historic defects closed by the kumiko+blend
  campaigns; the brepjs `applyMatrix` dist-patch stays tool-side BY DESIGN (brepjs pins
  the cache-alive contract) — re-target it on every brepjs bump
- **Wall-pattern honeycomb/triangle defects** — both tool-side (stamp keep-out, band
  layout); kernel exonerated. Tool #3294
- **Cone/cylinder ∪ box tangent section circle** — closed as collateral of #1357+#1360.
  `tangent_wall_fuse_configurations_stay_analytic`
- **Torus ray-cast arm** — `FaceGeom::Torus` + `math::intersect_line_torus`; TWO-RIM tube
  bands decline by design. `whole_torus_classifies_inside_and_outside`
- **Kumiko corner cut** — 4 roots (band rescue, graze scaling, chord-represented NURBS
  boundaries, reverse-twin misread). `kumiko_corner_window_inmem.rs` (fixtures gone with
  the parked branch; see OPEN)
- **Six-tool corner residual** — edge-midpoint fallback seed on a grazing ray;
  `interior_of_notched_polygon_clears_the_boundary` (pins verbatim f64 literals)
- **Segmented revolve inverted solids** — winding normalized; new oracle
  `measure::oriented_solid_volume` (plain `solid_volume` is a magnitude)
- **Arena `reserve` doubling** — bulk hint held both buffers, aborted the 4 GB wasm heap.
  `topology/src/arena.rs`
- **GFA multi-region acceptance** — rotated-bar AABBs, ring Euler surplus, ray-parity
  nesting. #1239
- **FF AABB pre-filter aliasing on straight sections** — exact slab-clip, gated to
  quadric partners. #1224, `goma_wall_band_cut_inmem.rs`
- **Tessellation nested-hole seeding** — centroid seeds identical for concentric wires;
  odd-depth rule. `oring_nested_holes.rs`
- **T-lip band cut** — depth probe overshot a 1.2 mm annulus. `lipband_cut_inmem.rs`
- **Label-sockets tab attach** — interior sampling blind to end overhang.
  `labeltab_attach_inmem.rs`
- **Intwidth wall tangency** — two solvers ±1e-6 apart on tangential intersections.
  `intwidth_tangency_inmem.rs`
- **Lite magnet-pad graze fuse** — graze heuristic keyed to face extent is blind to
  corner-window exits. `lite_pad_graze_fuse_inmem.rs`
- **Mesh-boolean co-refinement rewrite** — T-junctions, coplanar collapse, winding
  coin-flips. `relief_meshbool_fallback_inmem.rs`
- **Trimmed-torus ray-cast** — 3 stacked roots. `check/src/classify/ray_surface.rs`
- **Dovetail family** — `crates/io/tests/dovetail_*.rs`, `fracplate_seam_pocket_inmem.rs`
- **halfSockets / fractional-width / socket-assembly family** — `halfsockets_*.rs`,
  `fracwidth_corner_crescent_inmem.rs`, `socket_assembly_fuse_inmem.rs`
- **snapClip + fit-offset family** — `snapclip_*.rs`, `fitoffset_groove_mouth_inmem.rs`
- **Kernel-poison panic surface** — wasm32 is `panic=abort`, `catch_unwind` is INERT, a
  trap strands the borrow flag (recovery = new `BrepKernel`). Panic text survives via
  `crates/wasm/src/panics.rs`
- **Divider + floor pattern families** — 18 of 21 failures were ONE missing brepjs
  adapter method. Not a brepkit defect

## Refuted: do not re-try

- **A universal smarter merge-key for duplicate edges** — see TERMINAL; unbuildable.
- **Placing the thick-wall collapsed corner EXACTLY** (`nᵢ·(x−C) = radius − thickness`) —
  geometrically right, measured WORSE (20 → 318/544); moot with the chamfer strip shipped.
- **Ungated pendant-chain bridging in the face splitter** — fires at healthy corners and
  over-connects (use-3); the shipped version's three gates (section-free target, mutual
  nearest, isolation) are each load-bearing.
- **Cluster-canonical vertex adoption in `JunctionRegistry::resolve`** — net-negative;
  consumers that bypass endpoint resolution keep their own anchors.
- **Narrowing the DCEL-rescue gate by kumiko loop signature** — loop shape does not
  separate the corner wall from goma's bands (goma byte-identical under it).
- **"The constraint is the SPLIT ITSELF disturbing reconciliation"** — the newly-admitted
  splits were straight axis-aligned runs stored as NurbsCurve; a span-local sagitta gate
  fixes it.
- **`shell_is_outward_oriented` / `signed_volume_of_shell` being inverted** — both exact
  on a known-good cube (`flux_orientation_probe.rs`); the operand really was inward.
- **The goma odd bands as a GFA defect** — they were brepkit's own mesh-fallback output.
- **Ellipse aliasing at FF filter 2 on the goma lump** — a genuine 2× separation, not
  aliasing.
- Also refuted, each once: coincident coaxial cylinders as the corner-cut root; a
  classification error there (independent oracle agreed with GFA); plane-gated seed
  correction; arc-cornered wires as the nested-hole trigger; helix sweep as the goma
  cause (`helical_sweep_is_watertight_across_turns_and_segments`); upstreaming the
  brepjs intersectCurves eager-release (brepjs pins the cache-alive contract).

## Recurring traps (the distilled, expensive lessons)

- **Marched/fitted section geometry is good to ~1e-6; every exact-tol (1e-7) gate it
  meets needs a weld-scale (100·tol) band.** Four separate gaps in one family were this.
- **A sampled proxy gated at an exactness tolerance** is the single most common defect
  shape here (five instances): `best_d` bounded by sample SPACING, 16-sample AABB scans,
  uniform-t restriction, chord polygons under-covering by a sagitta.
- **Interior points of notched/symmetric sub-faces land on feature-plane intersections BY
  CONSTRUCTION** — classification must survive on-plane samples, and a seed must be
  STRICTLY interior. A centroid is not an interior point for concentric or non-convex
  wires.
- **When classifying which side of a face carries material, sample the face INTERIOR
  offset along its own normal; an edge or vertex point is never valid** (at a convex edge
  both sides read empty), and offset/deflection stability does not rescue a wrong sample
  point. For a non-convex open shell neither a bbox centre nor a vertex centroid is a
  valid interior sample.
- **The face splitter is a web of mutual calibrations.** Run ALL foils on any change:
  d4 gridfinity, honeycomb pcut1/pcut3, divider-lip, groove-mouth, junction-disc,
  cylinder-slot, a1corner. Each caught a different wrong discriminant.
- **A trigger keyed to a post-hoc failure signature cannot demote a working case** — the
  cheap way past those calibrations.
- **`solid_volume` is a MAGNITUDE**; only `oriented_solid_volume` sees an inverted or
  doubled shell. It is also translation-VARIANT on a malformed boundary, which needs no
  second oracle.
- **The by-edge-id manifold gate is BLIND to position-duplicate faces and edges.** "GFA
  validated OK" never proves watertight; use the position-quantized check.
- **All-planar output with zero curved faces, on a shape that should have cylinders, is
  the fallback tell** — but weak where the construction is legitimately planar.
- **Never replay a captured operand without printing its free/over counts first.**
  Captures can be fallback-poisoned; a whole iteration has been spent inside that trap.
- **Every `BK_*` knob is NATIVE-ONLY** (`std::env::var` returns Err on wasm32).
  `setLogLevel` + a JS ring buffer is the only handle on kernel internals from JS.
- **`log::debug!` in `fill_images_faces.rs` does not reach a custom logger** that
  receives `builder_solid`'s fine — probes there read as false zeros.
- **A fast-failing scenario family is a signal the failure is PRE-geometry.** Nothing
  doing real geometry fails 9 of 11 cases in 5.4 s.
- **Read raw log lines, not summary counters.** A capture regex missed
  `GFA boolean failed … falling back` and reported 0 rejections while 12 were present.
- **Verify the instrument fired, and verify which binary/branch a measurement came
  from.** `cargo build --tests` does not rebuild examples (stale-binary readings); a
  "compare against the parked branch" experiment was already answered because the
  measured kernel WAS that branch.
- **In nondeterminism digs, dump OPERANDS first.** Differential dumps at stage boundaries
  walk a flip upstream, but operand-construction ops (shell, extrude, sweep) are as
  suspect as the boolean — the coincident-fuse root was a HashMap iteration in shell_op.
- **Noise can be born at EMISSION, not intersection.** Probes at the phase level all lied
  once; the recipe that cracked it was an env-gated backtrace in `Vertex::new` on the
  literal coordinate.

## Tool-side measurement recipes and traps

- **Scenario numbers rot.** Always run the control on the SAME DAY and SAME catalog; a
  stale baseline has twice nearly produced a false conclusion.
- **Current baseline (2026-08-07, released 2.129.13 era, stock pins): the ENTIRE tool
  generator suite is GREEN — 272 files, 2720 passed, 0 failures.** Compare against a
  fresh same-day run, not old counts (the catalog grows continuously).
- **Overlay verification is mandatory and non-obvious.** Hash the file that
  `require.resolve('brepkit-wasm', {paths:[require.resolve('brepjs')]})` returns, run
  FROM the directory vitest will use. The foils worktree has its OWN `node_modules`. For
  a brepjs-side change, `npx vite build` then copy `dist/*`; methods live in
  content-hashed `shapeTypes-*.cjs` chunks, so grepping `brepjs.cjs` reads as "fix
  missing". The vitest resolve.alias does NOT reach the CJS require path — overlay
  node_modules and hash-verify, or you silently bench the installed kernel.
- **`pnpm exec vitest` triggers a dep check that wants to PURGE `node_modules`**
  (destroying any overlay). Drive `./node_modules/.bin/vitest` directly.
- **`vitest run --project generators` EXCLUDES `__kernel-tests__`** — those need
  `--config vitest.profile.config.ts`. Vitest does not surface `console.log` through a
  pipe: write probe results to a FILE.
- **Capture recipe:** wrap the RAW kernel's boolean entry points from a tool probe and
  `serializeSolid` each operand. A hook on `fuse` alone fires ZERO times — exports drive
  `fuseWithEvolution`/`cutWithEvolution`, scoops drive `filletVariable`, and much traffic
  goes through `executeBatch` (flatten batch ops when capturing). `compoundCut` passes
  tools as a Uint32Array — `Array.isArray` misses it, `ArrayBuffer.isView` is required;
  a number-only argument filter captures the base and silently drops every tool. Replay
  with `crates/io/examples/replay_pair.rs` (`A=`, `B=`, `OP=`, `TOOLS=<paths>` for
  compound cuts) or `replay_cut_capture.rs`.
- **A multi-case tool probe MUST make a fresh kernel per case, or run one case per
  process.** The kernel is a per-worker singleton whose borrow flag strands permanently
  on a trap; the first failing case poisons every later one. Cheapest fix is a `CASE=`
  env selector and one vitest invocation per case.
- **Do not compare a standalone probe number against a suite number** — in-matrix runs
  are cache-warm; the same scenario has measured bnd=0 standalone vs bnd=6 in-suite.
- **Tool probes under `__kernel-tests__` are UNTRACKED and get cleaned.** Budget for
  re-writing one. The tool is a SEPARATE repo other sessions commit to concurrently —
  check its `git status` before running anything there.
- **The foils worktree can vanish mid-session.** The probes survive on branch
  `diag/brepkit-kernel-foils` (local and origin); restore with `git worktree add`; it
  needs its OWN `node_modules`. Do NOT run measurements in the main tool checkout.
- **`brepkit-render`'s `compute_mesh_lod` SIGSEGVs intermittently** (pre-existing, ~50%
  of runs), aborting `cargo test --workspace` early and masking later suites. Use
  `--exclude brepkit-render`. Also: `cargo test --workspace` is fail-fast per binary —
  use `--no-fail-fast` when counting failures.
- Scenario snapshot tests pin EXACT reference-kernel triangle counts; a different kernel
  can never match them. Received-below-expected is benign density difference,
  received-10x-above is a defect.
- **Durable native probes/instruments** (env-gated, grep for them before writing new
  ones): `BK_FF_DUMP` / `BK_FF_TRACE` / `BK_RAWC` (phase_ff), `BK_SD_SETS`
  (same_domain), `BK_OPEN_SHELL` / `BK_SHELLS` (builder_solid shell grouping),
  `BK_SUBFACE_SRC` / `BK_SUBFACE_BOX` (builder — note BOX tests face VERTICES only),
  `POINT_IN` / `FREE_EDGES` / `TESS_BND` modes in `replay_pair`, `dump_solid` (per-wire
  edge ids), `audit_bin.rs` (HALFEDGE directed oracle — the authoritative winding
  oracle), `orient_scan.rs` / `fuse_orient.rs`, fillet instruments (`BK_FORCE_V2`,
  `BK_PIECES`, `BK_CORNER_TRACE`, `BK_TRIM_TRACE`, `BK_SPLIT_PREPASS`, `BK_NOTCH_TRACE`).

## Subsystem trap notes (crates without their own skill)

- **heal `fix_duplicate_faces` IS implemented** (solid-scoped,
  `crates/heal/src/fix/solid.rs`, returns `Status::DONE2`), not a no-op stub. It
  compares only centroid, normal, and edge count, so it can miss true-but-differently-
  wound duplicates. Verify current state before quoting either way.
- **heal, offset, and sketch have no distilled campaign knowledge.** They follow the

## Acceptance bar for a geometry campaign case

Every box before "closed":

- [ ] **Exact analytic result** where the inputs are analytic (typed faces, single to
      low-tens face count, not hundreds).
- [ ] **Watertight** tessellation (zero boundary edges).
- [ ] **Manifold** B-Rep (every edge used by exactly two faces, Euler balanced).
- [ ] **Full workspace suites green, INCLUDING** `cargo test -p brepkit-wasm --lib gridfinity`
      (running only algo/io/operations has shipped a gridfinity regression before).
- [ ] **Regression fixture shipped** with the fix (STEP or arena `.bin`; see `testing`).
- [ ] **Census clean or improved:** the row flips FALLBACK to analytic
      (`cargo run --release --example approx_census -p brepkit-operations`).
- [ ] **Head-to-head timing at least parity** (the brepjs wasm bench; see
      `parity-benchmarking`).
- [ ] **Release published** when user-facing (see `release-flow`).

## Anti-patterns

- Do NOT re-attempt a TERMINAL case hoping this time is different; it needs the named
  missing primitive, not another pass.
- Do NOT reach for the general solver when the narrow case is what parity needs.
- Do NOT call a case closed on an "exact analytic" census row alone; the census does not
  check correctness (see `analytic-preservation`).
- Do NOT quote a "deferred" or face-count claim without regenerating the inventory and
  re-probing scenarios; both rot silently.
- Do NOT close, defer, or discover an item and leave this skill unchanged — and when
  closing, DELETE the dig log rather than appending to it.
